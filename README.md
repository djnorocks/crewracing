[Crewracing](http://dtinth.github.com/crewracing/)
============

This page displays ongoing crew race data in a more easy-to-look way.

It downloads the [JSON data](http://tnk.dt.in.th/tnk2/data.js) from my website,
which is regenerated every 30 minutes from [DJMAX TECHNIKA2 website](http://www.djmaxcrew.com/crewrace/crewrace_ing.asp?page=1).
The fetching process is done by a PHP script. To see the code please look at the "server" branch.
